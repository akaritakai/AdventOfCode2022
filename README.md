This repo contains my Advent of Code 2022 solutions in Java 17. After providing it with your puzzle inputs (or your
session token), running the program will print out the answers to all days of the puzzle. A Docker image is provided to 
ensure compatibility with machines that do not want to install the Java 17 runtime.

The goal of this repo is to provide fast, highly tested, and easy-to-use solutions. When run on my PC (an AMD Ryzen 9
3950X), all answers are output in ~3.6 seconds. OCR is also automatically performed for Day 10's puzzle to avoid
requiring interpretation.

This repo may see changes in the future to improve runtime. If you have any suggestions, issues running the code, or
find a correctness error: please open an issue or pull request.

## Providing Your Puzzle Input

There are two supported methods for inputting your puzzle data into this application.

### Automatic Puzzle Fetcher (via Session Cookie)

First, get your cookie session data.

You will need to log into the Advent of Code website and then inspect your cookies.
If you are using Chrome, you can follow the directions [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/cookies).

You will be looking for a cookie called `session`. It will contain a long sequence of hexadecimal digits.

Place that data into a file called `cookie.txt` in the project directory.

The application will use that data to automatically fetch your puzzle input for each day.

### Manual Input

This code will also look in a particular location on your local machine for puzzle input.

In the project directory, it will check a directory called `puzzle`.
Within that directory it will expect Day 1's input to be in a file called `1`, Day 2's input to be in a file called `2`, etc.

You can find your puzzle input for a given day by logging into the Advent of Code website and then navigating to the URL
for that puzzle's input.

The URL for your puzzle input will be at:
```
https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/${DAY}/input
```
where `${DAY}` is the day number of the puzzle.

As an example, Day 1's input is at https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1/input,
Day 2's input is at https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2/input, etc.
